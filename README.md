# Caffenaware
This is a simple web applicaiton that calculate the caffeine decay.

There are two modes in this software. All caffeine amounts are calculated in mg. Method 1 is to enter only the total amount of caffeine. Method 2 calculates caffeine attenuation by entering the amount of caffeine per 100ml and how many ML of the drink were consumed.
